I am transitioning between OpenPGP keys.  Since 2005 I used this key:

pub   1024D/9D1D282C 2005-12-20
      Key fingerprint = 04A6 309A D560 D339 D027  2924 122C 47D9 9D1D 282C

Starting now I will begin using this key:

pub   4096R/97A51B47 2015-07-08
      Key fingerprint = F37E 5F67 394D 3592 5D37  EE66 5B00 71E0 97A5 1B47

The 9D1D key will continue to be valid for some time but I now will
start signing email with the 97A5 key and would prefer that everyone
use this new one when encrypting for me.  If you have trusted the old
key I request you likewise trust the new one.

This message is signed with both keys.
