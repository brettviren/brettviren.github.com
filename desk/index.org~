This describes a desk.  Not an actual desk but the concept of a desk.  An evolution of a desk.  A desk as a process.  A place to sit that holds items at fixed distances from me and themselves and the center of the Earth.

* Other desks.

Here are some ideas.

** Slide out surface

I don't like keyboard trays.  They feel too low, like I have to thread my arms into some maze to find the keys.  I also like to rest my arms on the same surface as the keyboard.  However, I do like the idea of keeping a clear working surface free of keyboard, mouse and other things.  I also like keeping cables out of site.

I happen to have four telescoping, ball-bearing slides which I pulled out of the garbage at work.
I've held on to these for years thinking, "some day these will be useful for *something*".

I would not be surprised if they were specially designed and hand machined for some experimental setup.  Two of the four slide smoothly.  The other two can probably be smoothed up with some cleaning of the build up aluminum oxide.  Their movement is otherwise very tight and precise.
They are made of three sections and are a total of 14" long when compressed and 27" when extended.  All sections lock open with two spring loaded hooks.  To retract them one can unlock the outer hook and pushing the slide in will hit the inner hook and unlock that.  Simple, clever design.  They feel pretty rigid and strong in all directions.
